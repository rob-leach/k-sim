# Contributing to k-sim

Contributions to this project are welcome.  If you'd like to contribute, raise an issue, or propose a new feature, please follow the procedures outlined below.

## Raising Issues

If you would like to fix a bug or request a bug fix, please [raise an issue](../../issues) so the issue can be documented and discussed.

## Making a Contribution

When you're ready to introduce yourself to the project, look for `help-wanted` issues. These are a great place to start with us!

We're currently a hobby project, as an external-contributor please consider the following:
- smaller line-count changes let us review/test quickly during our regular jobs.
- changes constrained to one of the four core areas let us all move together.

If you're a core-contributor, please do the same for your private-forked chagnes.
If you wish to author a large/long-running branch, please make it public and open a _Draft Pull Request_ with a prefix `WIP:` so we can keep up to date.

## How to contribute
Example:
1. Fork our project
    - If you are a core-contributor, please consider making your branch public within the repo.
1. Select an aspect of the project to improve:
    - Overall Layout (`k-sim/KSim.js`)
    - System visualization (`k-sim/vis/*`)
    - Simulation engine (`k-sim/engine/*`)
    - Simulation control compoments (`k-sim/ctl/*`)
1. Start a new branch for your feature.  
    - We're very relaxed on branch names.  
    - Be clear and concise on the goal of the branch.
1. Open and submit a pull request against `main`.
    - Thanks!  We don't have an SLA for turning these around, but we very much appreciate your attention and submissions!
